# zkring

zkring is a Java library for load balancing and partitioning, utilizing Apache ZooKeeper for distributed coordination and leveraging consistent hashing for efficient data distribution.
This library is designed to manage dynamic node membership changes and ensure minimal data movement, making it ideal for distributed systems requiring high availability and scalability.

## Features

- **Consistent Hashing**: Efficiently maps keys to nodes, ensuring minimal data movement when nodes are added or removed.
- **ZooKeeper Integration**: Utilizes ZooKeeper for managing node membership and coordinating changes across distributed systems.
- **High Availability**: Ensures continued operation even in the presence of node failures.
- **Scalability**: Easily scales with the addition of new nodes, handling increased load and data size.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes load evenly across nodes, optimizing resource utilization.
